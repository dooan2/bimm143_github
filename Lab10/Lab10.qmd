The main repository of biomolecular structure is the PDB <www.rcsb.org>

Download the csv file of PDB contents by experimental method and molecular type.
```{r}
pdb_data <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names=1)

sum.comma <- function(x){
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x)))
}
```
> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
sum_col <- apply(pdb_data, 2, sum.comma)
percent.xray.em <- (sum_col["X.ray"] + sum_col["EM"])/sum_col["Total"]
```
The percentage of X-ray and EM structures is `r percent.xray.em*100`. 

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
percent.protein <- as.numeric(gsub(",","",pdb_data[1,"Total"]))/sum.comma(pdb_data$Total)
```
The proportion of structures that are protein `r percent.protein`

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

There are 4445 structures. 

## Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

Mol* viewer is now everywhere <https://molstar.org/viewer/> 

Insert an image from Mol* here: 

1HSG (HIV)

![My first molecular image with aspartic acid and water highlighted.](1HSG.png)

## Working with the bio3d package

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
head(pdb$atom)
```
```{r}
pdbseq(pdb)[25]
```

## Predicting function motions of a single structure

We can do bioinformatics prediction of functional motions (ie. flexibility, dynamics)

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("6s36")
pdb
```
```{r}
m <- nma(pdb)
plot(m)
```
```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```

# Comparative Analysis of Protein Structures

Here we will work through complete pipeline of analysis for a given protein family starting from one single database ID for a member of this family all the way to a deeper understanding of structure, dyanmics, and function. 

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

```{r}
id <- "1ake_A"
aa <- get.seq(id)

```

```{r}
b <- blast.pdb(aa)
```
```{r}
hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
```


```{r}
# Download releated PDB files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

```{r}
# Align releated PDBs
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```
```{r}
pdbs
```


```{r}
# Perform PCA
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```

```{r}
# Visualize first principal component
pc1 <- mktrj(pc.xray, pc=1, file="pc_1.pdb")
```
